This is my first blog post. I'm not saying this to excuse myself, more as a means to convince me that these ramblings will eventually turn into something I deem worthy of putting in front of another human. I'm wrapping up my first tear at IBM and wanted to take some time to reflect on things I've learned.

While at the Zeit Day conference in San Francisco earlier this year, Scott Tolinkski said something in his talk that really resonated with me.

> “This industry won't let you become an expert. You always have to be a student.”

The student's mindset has become an invaluable tool throughout my first year. I'll be writing a short series on what these things mean to me in the context of becoming a better developer and person.

- Empathy
- Self-forgiveness
- Humility
- Learning – always learning.

I hope putting these ideas out into the universe will encourage myself and others to reach for the most courteous, and most open version of themselves.
